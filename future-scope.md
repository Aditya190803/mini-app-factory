# Future Scope for Mini App Factory

## New Features (Prioritized)

### 1. 🤖 AI Capabilities

- **Design-to-Code & Visual References**: Allow users to upload screenshots or Figma links. Use Vision models (GPT-4o or Gemini Flash) to analyze designs and fabricate matching HTML/Tailwind code.

### 2. ⚡ Developer Experience
- **Hot Module Reloading (HMR)**: Instant preview updates using a virtual file system in the browser iframe.
- **Visual Selector**: Click an element in the preview to automatically highlight its code or target it with AI instructions.

### 3. 🌐 Deployment & Sharing
- **One-Click Deployment**: Integrate with Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. Allow users to deploy to live URLs (e.g., `project-name.miniappfactory.com`) directly from the dashboard.
- **Project Branching**: Save "checkpoints" or branches to experiment with different design directions without losing progress.

### 4. 📊 Data & Form Handling
- Provide built-in support for simple backends. For example, a contact form that sends emails or saves submissions to a Convex database without writing server-side code.

### 5. 👥 Team Collaboration
- Enable shared projects where multiple users can work on the same site fabrication.
- Real-time cursor presence and collaborative AI prompting.

### 6. 🧩 Advanced Component Library
- Create a library of pre-built, AI-optimized interactive components (e.g., carousels, modals, tabbed interfaces, contact forms).
- Allow users to "drag and drop" these or specifically ask the AI to include them.
